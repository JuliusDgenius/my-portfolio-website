          I'm a curious problem-solver bridging the worlds of science and technology.
          With a foundational background in Biochemistry and formal training from the ALX Africa Software Engineering program, 
          I bring a unique analytical perspective to software development. 
          Currently contributing to a South African startup revolutionizing waste management, 
          I thrive at the intersection of backend systems and real-world impact. 
          My passion lies in building scalable solutions while continuously expanding my expertise into fullstack development.
